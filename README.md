# heart_rate_prediction-using-decison-tree-
#Overview
This repository contains code for predicting heart rate using a decision tree algorithm. Heart rate prediction is crucial for monitoring cardiovascular health, and machine learning techniques offer promising avenues for accurate prediction. In this project, we utilize a decision tree algorithm to predict heart rates based on a set of input features.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
#Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart_rate_prediction-using-decision-tree.git

#Copy code
cd heart_rate_prediction-using-decision-tree

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a collection of samples with various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., along with corresponding heart rates. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints, but it can be easily integrated by placing it in the data directory with the appropriate file name.

#Usage
Place your dataset file (in CSV format) containing the necessary features and heart rate values in the data directory.
Modify the config.py file to specify the file name and column names corresponding to features and the target variable (heart rate).
Run the decision_tree.py script:
#Copy code
python heart disease.ipynb
The script will train the decision tree model on the provided dataset and display evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Additionally, the trained model will be saved as a serialized file (heart_rate_prediction_model.pkl) for future use.
Model Evaluation
The decision tree model's performance is evaluated using various metrics to assess its predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into the model's ability to correctly predict heart rates based on the input features.
